# To run this program, the file server_key must exist on the server,
# containing an SSH private key for the server to use to authenticate itself
# to the client. An SSH certificate can optionally be provided in the file
# server_key-cert.pub.
#
# The file trusted_client_host_keys must also exist on the server, containing
# a list of trusted client host keys or a @cert-authority entry with a public
# key trusted to sign client host keys if certificates are used. This file
# should be in "known_hosts" format.
